A reminder for myself...

open `content` folder in obsidian

### preview page

```
npx quartz build --serve
```

### Build page

and each time I want to update page use command

```
npx quartz sync
```

### to add file to this

export target file using `markdown export` plugin from my main vault, so that it add image file along with text file
